# Introduction

This is an attempt to refactor and tidy up the code for my "grey room things" project that I did about a year ago. A working version of the project can be found at [greyroomethings.com](http://greyroomthings.com). 

# Dependencies

You need [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) and [middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) in order to get this working. 

Once you have those installed `middleman server` should run the development server on your localhost. If that doesn't work then `bundle exec middleman server` (this will obviously need [bundle](http://bundler.io/) installed to work).

To build `middleman build` or `bundle exec middleman build` should do the trick.
